# Robot Devices, Kinematics, Dynamics, and Control
## Course Description

Graduate-level introduction to the mechanics of robotic systems with emphasis on the mathematical tools for
kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems. Topics include the geometry and mathematical representation
of rigid body motion, manipulator kinematics including forward and inverse kinematics of articulated robot
arms, differential kinematics, manipulator dynamics and control. Additional special topics such as trajectory
generation, actuation, and design issues will be considered as time permits.
